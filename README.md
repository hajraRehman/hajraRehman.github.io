## 👋 About Me
I'm Hafiza Hajrah Rehman, a dedicated **Data Scientist and AI Researcher** passionate about crafting **trustworthy, interpretable, and secure AI systems**. Currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Saarland University, Germany, I blend rigorous theory with practical innovation in areas like adversarial machine learning, explainable AI (XAI), and efficient LLM fine-tuning.

From my roots in Pakistan to thriving in Germany's tech ecosystem, I excel at turning complex data into ethical, impactful solutions—whether hardening models against attacks, visualizing "what models see," or optimizing for low-resource domains like healthcare and IoT. As a mentor and community leader, I believe in accessible AI that empowers everyone.

> *"I believe in code that works, reports that explain, and models that can be trusted."*

Fluent in English, building German fluency, and always open to collaborations in **AI Research, ML Engineering, or Trustworthy AI** (with a secret NASA dream 🚀). Let's innovate responsibly!
