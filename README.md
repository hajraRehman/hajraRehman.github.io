## 🌍 About Me

I’m a passionate Data Scientist and AI researcher from Pakistan, currently pursuing my Master’s in Germany. I specialize in making AI systems **more secure, interpretable, and trustworthy** — because powerful models should also be responsible.  

When I’m not attacking models or explaining their decisions, I’m fine-tuning LLMs for science or building pipelines that turn messy data into actionable insights. I believe in **code that works, reports that explain, and models that can be trusted**.

I speak **English (Fluent)** and am learning **German** — embracing the challenge of building a global career in AI.
